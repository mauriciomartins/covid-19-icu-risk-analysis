# COVID-19 ICU Risk Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization of clinical data from COVID-19 patients to investigate factors associated with ICU admission.

The dataset was made publicly available through a research initiative involving **Hospital Sírio-Libanês (Brazil)** and released via Kaggle for predictive modeling purposes.

The objective of this project is to analyze demographic and clinical variables to better understand risk patterns associated with ICU admission.

## 🏥 Data Source

The dataset originates from **Hospital Sírio-Libanês**, one of Brazil’s leading medical institutions, and was published for research and educational purposes through Kaggle.

It contains anonymized clinical data including:

- Demographic information
- Laboratory test results
- Vital signs
- Time-windowed measurements during hospitalization
- ICU admission outcome

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Reduce redundant features and multicollinearity
- Aggregate patient-level data to avoid duplication bias
- Analyze ICU admission rates by age group and time window
- Explore clinical deterioration patterns over time
- Create interactive visualizations using Plotly

---

## 📈 Key Analyses

- ICU frequency by age group
- ICU rate progression across hospitalization windows
- Age distribution and ICU correlation
- Time-based ICU risk trends
- Correlation analysis between clinical markers and ICU outcome
